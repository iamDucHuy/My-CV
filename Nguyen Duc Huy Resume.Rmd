#### **Research Project**

  <img src="download.png" alt="Actual vs Predicted Inflation Rate" width="600px">
</p>
In this project, I explored the long-run relationship between monetary expansion and inflation, drawing from classical and monetarist theories such as the Quantity Theory of Money. I collected time-series data on money supply (M2), CPI, and GDP growth in Vietnam. Using R and Python, I applied OLS regression models and conducted stationarity tests to ensure robustness. The findings barely confirmed a positive correlation between money growth and inflation in Vietnam. This study helped reinforce my understanding of macroeconomic dynamics and the challenges of monetary policy design.  

#### **Campus Research**

This campus-based project aimed to develop practical solutions to reduce plastic waste across Eastern International University. I led a waste audit across key locations, conducted a survey, and identified the main sources of plastic use ‚Äî primarily bottled water and food packaging. Based on the data, we proposed policy recommendations such as refill stations, awareness campaigns, and incentives for reusable containers. Presenting these findings to EIU sustainability coordinators allowed me to see how data can drive real behavioral change.

#### **Field Study**

This independent qualitative study examined the mismatch between career expectations and workplace realities for Vietnamese migrants working in Japan under the "Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/International Services" visa. I designed a bilingual questionnaire and conducted in-depth interviews with Vietnamese professionals across Tokyo and Osaka. Common themes included cultural misunderstandings, overwork, and limited career mobility. The study emphasized the need for better pre-departure counseling and support mechanisms. It also sharpened my skills in qualitative data analysis, especially thematic coding and cross-case comparison.
